#### Lambda calculus


##### small note on lambda calculus.
Alonzo Church
introduced Lambda calculus in the 1930s, that works as the basics for functional programming.

For us Java developers, the concept helps by defining a new way of thinking about our code, it could actually be considered to be
more efficient (anonymous classes vs functional interfaces), as well as simplifying the syntax of our programs.
